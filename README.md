An e-commerce site that sells Yu-Gi-Oh cards. This website will allow users to look at Yu-gi-oh card prices add them to the cart then purchase these cards. Keep in mind that this is a fake test site to allow me to educate myself on a few coding concepts and how e-commerce sites work.

# Motivation
My motivation in creating this website is to follow through with the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and make an e-commerce site as it is important to grasp a good understanding of how e-commerce sites work as they are used all over the internet. Also since Yu-gi-oh was one of my favorite games in my childhood and also even good now, I would like to consume the YGOPRODeck API to fetch card data along with the card prices.
