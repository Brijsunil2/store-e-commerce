This website will allow users to look at store products and add them to the cart then purchase these products. Keep in mind that this is a fake test site to allow me to educate myself on a few coding concepts and how e-commerce sites work.

# Motivation
My motivation in creating this website is to follow through with the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and make an e-commerce site as it is important to grasp a good understanding of how e-commerce sites work as they are used all over the internet. I am choosing the Fake Store API site as it has common data on products that can be found on an actual store page of an e-commerce site.
